<instructions>
- Analyze the code for readability and maintainability issues.  
- Identify areas that could be simplified or made more clear.  
- Propose refactoring changes that maintain functionality.  
- Consider code organization, naming, and best practices.
- Refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, or structure (e.g., extract functions, rename variables, simplify logic).
- Clearly state the *goal* of the refactoring (e.g., "Extract method to reduce complexity", "Improve variable naming").
- Do **not** change the code's external behavior or functionality.
- Return the refactored code with explanatory comments if needed.
- Base your refactoring **solely** on the provided code context. Do not infer external dependencies or functionality not present in the code.
