- Analyze the code for performance bottlenecks (CPU usage, memory allocation, I/O operations).
- Suggest specific, actionable optimizations.
- Explain the reasoning behind each optimization.
- If modifying the code, return the optimized version with explanatory comments.
- Base your analysis and optimizations **solely** on the provided code context. Do not infer external factors or performance characteristics not evident in the code.
