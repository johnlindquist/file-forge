**Step 5: Consolidate Learnings (Post-Mortem)**

*   **Goal:** Reflect on the process of completing "{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}" and document key takeaways to share with the team.
*   **Action:** Write a brief post-mortem summary. Consider the following points:
    *   **What went smoothly?** Were there parts of the plan or code that worked particularly well?
    *   **What was challenging?** Did you encounter any unexpected difficulties, confusing code, or tricky debugging sessions?
    *   **Mistakes & Learnings:** Were there any mistakes made? What did you learn from them?
    *   **Surprises:** Did anything behave differently than you expected (e.g., library behavior, existing code interaction)?
    *   **Advice for Others:** If another developer were to tackle a similar task, what advice or warnings would you give them?
    *   **Time Estimate vs. Actual:** (Optional) Briefly note if the task took significantly more or less time than anticipated and why.

*   **Format:** Compile your thoughts into a concise summary.

*   **Sharing:** Add this post-mortem as a comment on the Pull Request you just created. This makes the learnings visible alongside the code changes.
    *   *Self-Correction Prompt: Make sure you are adding this comment to the correct Pull Request associated with this task.*

*   **Verification:** Confirm that your post-mortem comment has been successfully added to the Pull Request.
