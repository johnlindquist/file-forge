description: Create an implementation plan without branch creation - Generate step-by-step instructions with task tags
prompt: |
  **Goal:** Create a detailed implementation plan for the provided code.

  **Context:**  
  {code}

  <instructions>
  - Begin with a high-level summary clearly describing the goal of the task.
  - The numbered steps should be concise, explicit, and unambiguous.
  - Each step must contain a code snippet, command, or clear action that directly modifies the codebase.
  - Ensure each step is small, focused, and individually verifiable.
  - Verify:
    - Include instructions to programmatically verify each commit.
    - If tests exist, please add a test.
    - If tests don't exist, add manual instructions to verify.
  - End each step by clearly instructing the developer to commit their changes using standard GitHub workflows.
  - IMPORTANT: NEVER use newline characters in Git commit messages as they can break workflows. Always use multiple '- m' parameters instead.

  - **High-Level Summary:**
    - Clearly describe the overall goal of completing the <task/>.

  - **Step 1: Implement Code Changes**
    - **Action:** Modify the relevant files to address the <task/>:
      ~~~bash
      # Example: edit necessary file
      vim path/to/file.js
      ~~~
    - **Verification:** Run the existing application or relevant commands to verify functionality.
    - **Commit:** Stage and commit changes with a semantic commit message:
      ~~~bash
      # IMPORTANT: Always use multiple -m parameters instead of newlines
      git add .
      git commit -m "fix/feat/etc: Implement changes for <task/>" -m "brief description" -m "additional context if needed"
      ~~~

  - **Step 2: Add or Update Tests**
    - **Action:** Add new tests or update existing ones covering the changes made:
      ~~~bash
      vim path/to/tests/test_file.js
      ~~~
    - **Verification:** Ensure tests pass:
      ~~~bash
      npm test
      ~~~
    - **Commit:** Stage and commit test changes with a semantic commit message:
      ~~~bash
      # IMPORTANT: Always use multiple -m parameters instead of newlines
      git add .
      git commit -m "fix/feat/etc: Add/update tests for <task/>" -m "verify feature behavior"
      ~~~

  - **Step 3: Push Changes**
    - **Action:** Push your changes:
      ~~~bash
      git push
      ~~~
    - **Verification:** Open GitHub and confirm your changes are visible.
    - **Commit:** No commit required; pushing completes your task.
