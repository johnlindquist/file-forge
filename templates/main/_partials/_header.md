# Guide: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}} ({{ GENERATION_DATE }})

**Summary:** Mandatory steps for "{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}". Follow precisely. Iterate quickly, verify constantly.

**Principles:**

- **Strict Order:** Follow steps exactly.
- **Attempt Limit (Code/Test Steps):** Max 3 attempts. Announce attempt #. If verify fails on Attempt 3, STOP & report failure. Don't proceed.
- **Mandatory Verify:** Verify _as instructed_ at each stage. DON'T proceed if verification fails (respect 3 attempts). Success = progress.
- **Commit Discipline:** Commit _only_ when instructed, post-success, using specified format.
- **Complete All:** Finish the entire sequence.

**Goal:** Execute plan efficiently, proving progress via verification. Strict adherence is key.
