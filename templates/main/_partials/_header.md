This guide outlines the precise, incremental steps to successfully implement "{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}". It enforces a strict **commit-per-step workflow** using Git. Each step includes implementing or testing a specific change, **mandatory verification**, analysis of potential impacts on other files, and finally, a dedicated commit. Adhering strictly to these steps is crucial for code quality, clear history, and smooth integration.

*(Note: Adapt package manager commands like `pnpm run ...` or `npm test` to match your project's setup: `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.)*
